  GitApi.getAllWeeklyData(username)
    getUserRepos(username) - grabs from cache or github api - https://api.github.com/users/RioaM/repos (returns cache entry) then for each repo
    getRepoWeeklyData(repo, username)
     -grap the weekly data of contributions for repo

then -- so now have all weekly contribution data per repo
  GitApi.reduceAllWeeklyData(data -calculates weekly data, can change so look at weekly 
    -gets passed an Array of objects 10 in length
      -some object are undefined - these are forked repos with no contribution from user
      -some are defined
        -author, numContribuors, total, url, weeks
           -weeks is an array of object of variable length
              -each object contains a-,c,d,w
  change for each repo and languages
  chart
then
 GitApi.gatherLanguageData(data) - how much user has contributed
   getLanguageStats(repo) - returns languages with the number of bytes of code written in that language.

  pie chart


  Weekly Hash

w - Start of the week, given as a Unix timestamp.
a - Number of additions
d - Number of deletions
c - Number of commits

a = for each week get users additon per week
b = for each week get language stats on repo *** can't do this weekly
c = for each week get total additons to repo

chart point = a/c * b
  -so get the % user contributed and multipy by the total language usage


-total code = addition - deletions
